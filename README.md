Gun violence is a persistent issue in the United States. Every day, lives are lost and people are injured as a result of firearms. 
<br><br>
When learning about this issue, I was shocked to see how many instances of gun violence occur on a daily basis. I made this [simple web app](https://zerodays.live/)-- built using Flask and deployed with Docker-- to help others visualize how prevalent gun related injury and death is across our country. And, since person-to-person information sharing is one of the most effective ways to generate interest in an issue, I created a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/zerodayslive) that publishes daily summaries of gun violence in the US and allows individuals to publish auto-generated Tweets to their own accounts.

Not everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced.
