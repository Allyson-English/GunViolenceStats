# GunViolenceStats

Gun violence is a persistent issue in the United States. Every day, lives are lost and people are injured as a result of firearms.

When learning about this issue, I was shocked to see how many instances of gun violence occur on a daily basis. I made this [simple web app](https://zerodays.live/)-- built using Flask and deployed with Docker-- to help others visualize how prevalent gun related injury and death is across our country. The database that fuels this site also publishes daily summaries of gun violence on an [automated Twitter account](https://twitter.com/zerodayslive).
